The second most popular question following the ["Why you shoot film?"](http://rpk.io/posts/why-I-shoot-film/) is **"What gear you own and use?"**

So this is the list of all the gear I own and use!

## **Bronica GS-1**
with **Zenzanon PG 100mm f/3.5** and **Zenzanon PG 65mm f/4**  
![Bronica GS-1 - Zenzanon PG 100mm f:3.5 and Zenzanon PG 65mm f:4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rpk0/rpk_site/gh-pages/images/posts/my_gear/Bronica%20GS-1%20-%20Zenzanon%20PG%20100mm%20f:3.5%20and%20Zenzanon%20PG%2065mm%20f:4.jpg)

this is my main camera, the one that I carry with me when I go out to photograph, from landscapes to portraits. 

I am very happy with the camera as it produces very good results,
it has good metering with the AE prism and sharp lenses.

**Tip:**
*Focusing improved dramatically when I changed the regular focusing screen with a split-screen. I recommend this upgrade to anyone with a GS-1.*

The built quality is also very good, solid with good ergonomics which makes the use of the camera pretty easy.

The **Zenzanon PG** series of lenses are excellent, sharp across the field even when wide open and can be found in very reasonable prices.

Due to my work style ([urban landscapes](http://rpk.io/photo_essays/on_the_road/)) I mostly use the *PG 65mm* and whenever I shoot portraits I use the *100mm* one.

The only weakness of the lenses is that they are a bit slow (3.5) and they don't have "character" in their bokeh.

Many people say that the GS1 is light and compact for a 6x7 SLR but I can't even imagine how other 6x7 SLRs are, because for me this one feels **monstrous** 

I use mine with AE prism and the speedgrip which clearly adds extra weight and size but improves dramatically the handling and use of the camera.

Conclusion: 
Bronica GS-1 is **the best 6x7 SLR** you can get in this price range (600$ with 2 lenses in 2015)
You get **amazing results** if you know how to use it, **large negatives**, **awesome lenses**, **many accessories** and the ability to select between **different formats (6X6, 645)**.

## **Contax G1** 
with **Contax G Zeiss 28mm f/2.8 Biogon**
![Contax G1 - Contax G Zeiss 28mm f:2.8 Biogon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rpk0/rpk_site/gh-pages/images/posts/my_gear/Contax%20G1%20-%20Contax%20G%20Zeiss%2028mm%20f:2.8%20Biogon.jpg)

This is a new arrival to fill the gap of a small, quality 35mm camera that I will carry with me as a backup to the medium format. 

I used to have an Olumpus XA2 for this job but its constraints led me to search for a better one. 

I found the Contax G1 in a bargain and bought it, I don't need to say much about the Contax G system, it is **one of the best 35mm systems** you can find out there. [Ken Rockwell Review](http://www.kenrockwell.com/contax/g-system.htm)

The only "problem" is that eventually it is not going to be a replacement of the Olympus XA2. Its bigger, heavier and feels more fragile. I carry the XA2 everywhere inside my everyday backpack, something you can't do with the precious Contax. 

Where I use the Contax: 

- Backup to the Bronica GS-1 in my photography roadtrips
- Main camera in my urban wanderings
- Loaded with black and white film for my [black and white projects](http://rpk.io/photo_essays/roadtrip_snapshots/) :) 

## **Olympus OM2n** 
with **Zuiko Auto-W 28mm f/3.5**
![Olympus OM2n - Zuiko Auto-W 28mm f:3.5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rpk0/rpk_site/gh-pages/images/posts/my_gear/Olympus%20OM2n%20-%20Zuiko%20Auto-W%2028mm%20f:3.5.jpg)

This is a very good camera but I have never used it. Bought it around the same time I bought the Olympus XA2 and maybe thats a good excuse for not using it. 

The camera is **very small**, has a **solid build** and a **fantastic viewfinder**. I can not say much about it because I have shot only 3 or 4 films with this one. 

Someone could say that with the entry of the Contax G1 this camera became obsolete, but I don't think so, the Contax is an AF rangefinder with expensive lenses and accessories when the **OM2n** is a classic manual focus SLR with a **huge selection of good and affordable lenses**. 

I don't know if I will ever shoot actively with it but I will not sell it for the following 3 reasons:

1. It is my only 35mm SLR camera
2. It is not worth a lot of money
3. It is one of the best looking SLRs 

## **Olympus XA2**
![Olympus XA2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rpk0/rpk_site/gh-pages/images/posts/my_gear/Olympus%20XA2.jpg)

This is one of my favorites cameras. Why? Because I have it with me all the time! 

**XA2** comes in a tiny clamshell body with an awesome, sharp, contrasty little Zuiko 35mm 1:3.5 4-element lens.

It offers **automatic exposure** and **zone focusing**. This means that the only thing you can control is the focus zones which are splited in three groups: close (1.2m-1.8m), near (1.2-6.3m) and far (6.3m-infinity).

This focusing system is one of the biggest disadvantages in my opinion, I have many out of focus images and with their mediocre quality these images are unusable. 

Overall this is my favorite take-everywhere film camera and responsible for this great set: [Roadtrip Snapshots](http://rpk.io/photo_essays/roadtrip_snapshots/)

## **Olympus OMD EM-5**
with **M.Zuiko 12-50mm f/3.5-6.3 ED** and **Panasonic LUMIX G 20mm f/1.7**
![Olympus OMD EM-5 - LUMIX G 20mm f:1.7 and M.Zuiko 12-50mm](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rpk0/rpk_site/gh-pages/images/posts/my_gear/Olympus%20OMD%20EM-5%20-%20LUMIX%20G%2020mm%20f:1.7%20and%20M.Zuiko%2012-50mm.jpg)

It's 2015, you can't live in this year and not have a good digital camera. There are moments where the advantages of a digital camera make it indispensable.

**The right tool for the right job.**

Trips with friends, events and concerts are some occasions where I bring the **OMD** with me.
This **amazingly build little camera** produces very good images and has these 4 fantastic features that I love: 

1. Small size (with the 20mm Panasonic fits in your jacket pocket)
2. Weather sealing (many new opportunities emerge)
3. 5-axis image stabilization 
    - Helps shoot in low light (1/4 sec its an easy shoot)
    - You can easily mount and play with older lenses
4. Fast autofocus with most Micro Four Thirds lenses 

Bonus point: **It's beautiful!** :) 

I will upgrade this camera when I found the same package with better ISO performance and maybe a full frame sensor. 

## **Holga 120CFN (6x6), Smena Symbol 35mm**

Double exposures, light leaks and unexpected results. It is so much fun to use these two plastic cameras!
